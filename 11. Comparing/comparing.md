# Comparing numbers in Circom

We operate in modulo, over a finite field.
Therefore, there are no negative numbers, just equivalence classes:

> Cannot compare numbers in a finite field, as there is no meaning in saying one number is larger than another number.

## Implementing < in Circom

**Requirements**

1) Numbers must be smaller than the field size,
2) Treat any numbers in the field as positive integers
3) Carefully guard against underflow and overflow.

We can compare numbers by using their binary form.

Letâ€™s say we are comparing x and y, where x,y[0, 9].
One is larger than the other variable, we don't know which.

Since 9 is the largest value our inputs can take, we add 10 to the x and subtract the y from the sum of x and y.

    `z = (10 + x) - y`

For any and all values of x and y, z will be positive (>0).
By adding the 10, we safeguard against underflow as we are dealing with finite field elements.

If x >= y:
    z = [10, 19]

If x < y:
    z = [1, 9]


Assumes that in[0] and in[1] are n-bit numbers.


Assume x=2, y=1,
    x = b(10)
    y = b(1)

    therefore, n = 2.

    component n2b = Num2Bits(2+1); 


    2 + (1 << 2) - 1 = 5
                     = b(101)

    out = 1 - n2b.out[n] 
        = 1 - n2b.out[2]
        = 1 - 0
        = 1

x > y: component returns 1 (but it should return 0?)
    

## why must  Num2Bits(2+1) be n+1?

- for loop: i<n
- if we supply n =2, i = 0,1
-n+1, i = 1,...,n
